<Desc><entry>Assessment appointments are held at the Central Health Clinic on Monday evenings.  Operations are performed under local anaesthetic only, on Wednesdays at the Central Health Clinic.  If general anaesthesia is required, hospital referral is required.  Post-operative semen samples are required at week 16 and week 20 following operation.  When 2 consecutive samples are clear of sperm, the man is considered sterile; until then alternative contraception must still be continued.  Referrals are only accepted for men aged 27 years and over whose partner is not pregnant and whose youngest child is not less than 9 months of age unless there are overriding medical problems.  Referral by GP or Family Planning Clinic or self-referral.</entry>
