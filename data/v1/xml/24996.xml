</OrgName>
<Desc><entry>LiShi is an ancient Daoist exercise system that can teach you to access your own energy source and potential.  It has been passed on from master to master for thousands of years making its way from China to England in the 1930's.  It is a holistic exercise system that focuses on relaxed physical movement, deep breathing, concentration and the activation of your own internal energy.  There can be many benefits from practicing these arts including relaxation, concentration and increased vitality.  There are many different types of exercise that are practiced, some done individually and some with partners but always with a sense of vitality and co-operation.  Not for profit.</entry>
