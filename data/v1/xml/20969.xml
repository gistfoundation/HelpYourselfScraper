<AltName><entry>CHURCHES TOGETHER IN BROOMHILL AND BROOMHALL YOUTH CLUB</entry>
</AltName>
<Desc><entry>A registered charity that runs a youth club for girls aged 11-16 years.  The club provides a secure environment for young people to enjoy themselves once a week.  Although the club is organised by joint churches in Broomhill, and some of the leaders are church members, there is no religious content to the activities.  Provides a contact point for members of the community and encourages individuals of all backgrounds to come together in a relaxed atmosphere.  Current membership is almost exclusively from ethnic minority backgrounds.  Activities are aimed at being constructive and inclusive without being overtly educational, and include table tennis, snooker, bar football, outside football and basketball during the summer months, craft/art activities and cooking. The club intends to start running trips and residentials and encourages contact and engagement with the parents of young people in order to facilitate this.</entry>
