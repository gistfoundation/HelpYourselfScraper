<OrgName><entry>SHEFFIELD SKEPTICS IN THE PUB</entry>
</OrgName>
<Desc><entry>Hosts talks, usually by a notable scientist or skeptic, in a relaxed and friendly atmosphere.  Subjects will vary considerably, but will typically be about a common belief that either cannot be justified by the available evidence or that can actually be demonstrated to be false by the available evidence.  Talks are followed by an informal question and answer session/discussion.  Everyone welcome, no matter what their prior beliefs are.  Open to those aged 18 years and over due to the nature of the venue.</entry>
