<Desc><entry>Part of Sheffield City Council.  Responsible for ensuring that privately let accommodation in the city meets reasonable health and safety standards.  Advises landlords and tenants on standards and has legal powers to instruct landlords to improve their properties.  Runs the Council's Responsible Landlord Scheme.  Advises on standards for houses in multiple occupation, including lettings to asylum seekers and provides the mandatory licensing of certain houses of multiple occupation (HMO) where 5 or more occupants live on 3 or more floors.  Promotes good standards and management across all types of lettings.   Deals with empty properties by encouraging owners of privately owned empty properties to renovate, let them out, occupy the property themselves or alternatively sell them to someone else.  Also deals with nuisance associated with empty properties such as rubbish that could cause vermin or disrepair causing damage to another property.</entry>
