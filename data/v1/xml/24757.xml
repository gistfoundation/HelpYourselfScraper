<OrgName><entry>SHEFFIELD COMMUNITY JUSTICE PANELS</entry>
</OrgName>
<Desc><entry>Part of Sheffield City Council.  Brings victims and wrongdoers together to resolve conflict and harm caused by anti-social behaviour and crime.  The Panels encourage wrongdoers to acknowledge the impact of what they have done and make amends to the victim and the wider community by apologising and engaging in reparative work.  Community Justice Panels (CJP) are not designed to punish, but they are not a soft option either, as they make the offender face up to the impact of what they have done.  CJPs deal with low-level crime and anti-social behaviour, including neighbour disputes, criminal damage, thefts and assaults.  Both parties have to agree to meet and through a structured discussion come to an agreement about the best way to resolve the problem.  At the conclusion of the panel, the victim and offender sign a Community Justice Agreement.  Volunteers are welcome and training is provided, please contact for details.</entry>
