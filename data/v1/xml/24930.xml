<OrgName><entry>SHINE OUT ON SATURDAYS (SOS)</entry>
</OrgName>
<Desc><entry>A performing arts project aimed at children and young people aged 8-16 years with a learning disability and/or a sensory impairment.  The project runs two groups, which attend on alternate Saturdays.  The first hour of the session is dedicated to drama, movement, dance and music, followed by a break providing the opportunity to have a drink, snack and a chat to friends.  The last hour is spent doing art activities.  The aim of the project is to use performing arts as a tool to promote self-confidence and independence.  SOS employs two specialist workers, as well as volunteers, who work with group members on a long-term basis, in order to nurture good relationships.</entry>
