<Desc><entry>Subud is a spiritual practice which offers a direct and individual experience of the creative life energy of God.  Gradually this brings personal change and growth.  Subud is not a religion, cult or sect and is open to anyone without discrimination.  Subud Britain has active social, cultural, youth and enterprise wings.  The Sheffield group is working with local women's groups in Darnall to provide a community space for their activities.</entry>
