<Desc><entry>Sheffield is one of 9 designated healthy towns receiving funding until 2011.  An initiative to prevent obesity in children, young people and families through shifting attitudes and culture in the city at all levels.  Aims to achieve this through eight themes: making Sheffield a breastfeeding friendly city; supporting parents in being positive rolemodels in healthy living; schools empowering children to live healthy lives; creating living neighbourhoods, removing the barriers to healthy living from neighbourhoods and creating environments that promote wellbeing; creating healthy and safe open spaces for children and parents to play; developing an effective social marketing campaign to achieve positive behavioural change; establishing a network of local volunteers to support local communities to live healthier lives; building partnerships and cross sector support to the obesity prevention agenda.</entry>
