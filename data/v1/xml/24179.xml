<OrgName><entry>URBAN RANGERS</entry>
</OrgName>
<Desc><entry>A project aimed at engaging with young teenagers, involving volunteers recruited from the South Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Cadet Scheme.   Volunteers must be aged 16 years or over and receive training in areas such as first aid, arson intervention and general fire safety.  Once trained the volunteers work in partnership with the City Centre Ambassadors, patrolling the city centre and utilising their new skills with the aim of being pro-active in reducing the number of arson related incidents.  The Urban Rangers act as ambassadors for the Fire Service and its partner agencies, enabling them to connect with all members of the community and in particular younger members of society who can be difficult to engage with.  Urban Rangers also are involved in local community initiatives which may include working with young people aged 8-14 years and are trained to carry out home fire risk assessment and fit fire alarms.  Also canvas for free smoke alarms</entry>
