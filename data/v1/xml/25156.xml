<OrgName><entry>FOUNDATION PLACEMENT SCHEME MEDIA TRAINING</entry>
</OrgName>
<Desc><entry>A training initiative developed to address minority ethnic under-representation in the media industry across the Yorkshire &amp; Humber region.  The scheme is funded through Yorkshire Forward and delivered through Screen Yorkshire, working in partnership with ITV, BBC and Skillset as well as a range of media &amp; broadcasting companies to offer hands-on industry training experiences.  Trainees can receive up to 12 months experience whilst being paid a training bursary.  In addition, trainees can benefit from a bespoke training and development programme, buddy and mentor support, personal and career development and a contribution to childcare expenses where applicable.  The traineeship has been developed in accordance with Section 37 &amp; 38 of the Race Relations Act 1976, to encourage the potential of Black, Asian and Minority groups in Positive Action training in areas of employment where there is shown to be an under-representation.</entry>
