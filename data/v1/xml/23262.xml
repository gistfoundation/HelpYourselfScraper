<Desc><entry>A student-led volunteer group that organises activity days for children aged 8-11 years from Sheffield who have recently experienced a close family bereavement.  Provides fun days, which include craft activities in the morning and more outgoing, adventurous pursuits in the afternoon.  Receives referrals from Sheffield Cruse Bereavement Support (see separate entry), St Luke's Hospice (see separate entry), local primary schools and Sheffield Children's Hospital.  Operates a one-to-one relationship between volunteer and child to ensure the highest level of care and ensures that children are given individual attention.  The team have all completed CRB Enhanced Disclosures and have completed training courses in Child Protection and Understanding Behaviour organised by Sheffield Volunteering.</entry>
