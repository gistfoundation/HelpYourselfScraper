<OrgName><entry>SHEFFIELD COMMUNITY BRAIN INJURY REHABILITATION TEAM (SCBIRT)</entry>
</OrgName>
<Desc><entry>The SCBIRT is a city-wide community out-patient service provided by Sheffield Primary Care Trust.  The broad purpose of the service is to enable those with a brain injury and their carers to resume their everyday life within the constraints imposed by injury severity and available community resources.  The team acts as the primary community-based rehabilitation component and sees adults with traumatic brain injury soon after their injuries, as well as working with people with traumatic and other forms of acquired brain trauma many years post onset.  The team has now received funding to extend these services (a) to those with non-traumatically acquired brain injury soon after their injury and (b) to those who have mild traumatic brain injury who remain symptomatic.</entry>
