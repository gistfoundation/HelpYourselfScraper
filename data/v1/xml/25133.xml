</AltName>
<Desc><entry>Children and young people with Pathological Demand Avoidance (PDA) find being asked to do things, even simple everyday things, extremely difficult and try hard to avoid these demands.  PDA is increasingly recognised as part of the autistic spectrum.  It is a lifelong condition and  people with PDA will require different amounts of support depending on how their condition affects them.  PDA Contact is a national support group for people diagnosed or dealing with the condition which runs a local support group in Sheffield.  The Sheffield support group runs it's own helpline providing support and information and organises monthly meetings.</entry>
