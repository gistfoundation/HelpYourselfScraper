Also manages the Community Health Champions programme in Sheffield, whereby Voluntary Health Champions are recruited to work within their community to promote healthy eating, physical activity and mental wellbeing through a range of activities.  The programme has currently given 20 member organisations the opportunity to deliver the project locally.
