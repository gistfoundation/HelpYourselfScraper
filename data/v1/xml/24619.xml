<Desc><entry>Computers 4 Africa is a registered charity that collects computers and other working IT equipment (less than 5 years old) and ships it to schools across Africa.  The charity organises a country-wide network of collections, typically by arrangement with the owners of unused retail warehouses where they hold 2 day appeals for donations from the public, which includes a regular collection site in Sheffield.  Also offers a collection service for donations of 10 or more computers that meet the minimum requirements (see website for more details), and guarantees to data-wipe hard drives and check performance before shipping the computers to Africa.  Over 4,000 computers have already been shipped as a result of the support from businesses, individuals and educational facilities.  Company limited by guarantee no 5210348.</entry>
