<AltName><entry>SHEFFIELD INTERIM PARENT CARERS FORUM</entry>
</AltName>
<Desc><entry>A parent-led organisation which aims to give parents and carers of disabled children and young people, aged 0-19 years, a strong voice in influencing local developments that affect their children.  The group tries to keep parents informed about important news and events via its mailing lists, newsletters, website, bi-annual conferences, talks and meetings as well as established links with local parent support groups.  Parents views are gathered systematically and fed back to decision-makers by parents reps who sit on various strategic groups and committees.  The forum also provides the opportunity for parents to exchange information and support each other.  The forum does not currently have the capacity to deal with individual cases but will signpost parents to other groups and agencies that can help them.</entry>
