It can also be used to help clients with their contributions to a disability facilities grant.  The loan is an equity release loan that allows homeowners to release available equity within their properties in order to make their homes decent.  The clients will make no monthly repayments for the life of the loan.  The loan only becomes repayable when the client transfers ownership of their property.</entry>
