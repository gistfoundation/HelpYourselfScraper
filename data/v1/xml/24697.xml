<OrgName><entry>BLACK AND MINORITY ETHNIC (BME) HOUSING STRATEGY MONITORING GROUP</entry>
</OrgName>
<Desc><entry>A small, informal group made up of a wide range of representatives from the BME community, which plays a key role in developing and monitoring Sheffield City Council's BME Housing Strategy and wider housing policies and services delivered by the council and its partners.  The group meets approximately 8 times per year to discuss a theme relating to housing and neighbourhoods, and sets goals and targets that help to achieve the BME Housing Strategy.  New members are always welcome as the group needs service users' experiences, views and expertise to help develop the Council's housing services to fully meet the needs of Sheffield's BME communities.</entry>
