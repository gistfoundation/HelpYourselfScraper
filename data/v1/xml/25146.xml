<OrgName><entry>OLDER FAMILIES PLANNING PROJECT</entry>
</OrgName>
<Desc><entry>Many people with learning disabilities live at home with their family carers.  Many of these families are growing older together and worry about what will happen in the future.  The project aims to help older families to: get the support they may need now to continue staying together as long as they both wish; prepare for emergencies; plan for housing and support that may be required in the future.  Run by Sheffield City Council's Accommodation Development Team, working in partnership with the Sharing Caring Project (see separate entry).</entry>
