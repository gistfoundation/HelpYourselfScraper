<OrgName><entry>DYSTONIA SOCIETY, THE (TDS)</entry>
</OrgName>
<Desc><entry>A registered charity that provides support and information for patients and relatives with dystonia, including spasmodic torticollis, blepharospasm, writer's cramp and generalised dystonia.  These are neurological disorders which cause involuntary muscle spasm and tremor and are thought to be due to a chemical imbalance in the basal ganglia of the brain.  The South Yorkshire contact provides support by telephone, and the Dystonia Society organises activities where sufferers can meet others with the same condition.  There are no restrictions on attendance at meetings but people are encouraged to join the Dystonia Society.</entry>
