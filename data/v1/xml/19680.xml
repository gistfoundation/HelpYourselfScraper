<OrgName><entry>READING MATTERS</entry>
</OrgName>
<Desc><entry>A registered charity which delivers a volunteer reading mentor support network and a range of programmes to support pupils who are struggling with their reading skills and confidence.  Reading mentors are permanent volunteers who work with pupils one-to-one and who are recruited, trained and supported by Reading Matters.  "Parents and Carers as Partners" is a training course to enable parents and carers to support children of all ages with their literacy, develop their own skills and help build an inclusive school community.  "Reading Leaders" is a one-off practical and fun workshop for Key Stage 4 and 5 pupils to gain the skills and confidence to partner younger pupils in one-to-one supported reading sessions.  Participants in these programmes can gain level 2 accreditation with the Open College Network.</entry>
