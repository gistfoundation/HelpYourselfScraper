<Desc><entry>Provides a free independent advocacy service for disabled adults or family carers of disabled children living in Sheffield who have issues relating to health or social care.  Provides help with challenging services to be different which can be difficult or overwhelming without some help.  The advocacy team is experienced in working with disabled people and can help you secure any reasonable changes people may want to make to their health and social care.  Once you have got in touch the service will discuss anything you may need assistance with and if appropriate make an appointment to meet you.  If you are unable to meet at the office a home visit can be arranged.</entry>
