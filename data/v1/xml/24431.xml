<OrgName><entry>SOUTH COMMUNITY ASSEMBLY</entry>
</OrgName>
<Desc><entry>Community assemblies bring door-step democracy to where you live.  Essential decisions that were made in the Town Hall will now be made within communities.  Residents of Sheffield will have more opportunities to influence services in their area to meet their needs and reflect what local people want.  Each community assembly has a budget and will ask communities how this should be spent on local projects.  Communities will also be able to influence decisions on how much is spent on parks, street cleaning and libraries, and more services will be added in the future.  The South Community Assembly covers the 4 wards of Gleadless Valley, Graves Park, Beauchief and Greenhill.  You can contact your community assembly team through your local ward councillor.</entry>
