<Desc><entry>Offers a service whereby people can donate their bodies to medical science.  Because it is not possible for donors to bequeath their body in a legal sense, it is advisable that their relatives are informed and that their approval is sought.  No payment is made to donors or their relatives, but the University will meet all reasonable cremation charges using B&amp;C Funeral Directors, Suffolk Road, Sheffield.  Should the family/next-of-kin wish to make their own private funeral arrangements, then they would incur the cost.  A bequest/bequeathal letter or form MUST have been signed and, if completed after September 2006, it must have a witness signature.  Please contact for further details and an application form.</entry>
