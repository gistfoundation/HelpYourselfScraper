<Desc><entry>Sheffield's Green Bond is a no-risk investment scheme set up so individuals and businesses can show support for Sheffield's natural environment.  Money invested in the Bond is planted in the bank for five years and the interest raised is used to support voluntary and community groups which care for and maintain the city's green spaces and waterways, and engage young people in improving the environment.  Individual investment starts at as little as Â£25 and the initial sum of money is returned to the investors after the fixed term has elapsed.</entry>
