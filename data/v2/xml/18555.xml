<AltName><entry>WEST MENTAL HEALTH SUPPORT SERVICE</entry>
</AltName>
<Desc><entry>Offers a service to people in the West of Sheffield with severe and enduring mental health problems.  Outreach and drop-in service.  Provides support with two broad areas of need: help with developing or redeveloping daily living skills (eg budgeting, shopping, household tasks, etc); helping people to find fulfilling ways of spending their time and developing social networks as a result.  This will often involve signposting to other organisations.  Areas covered could include such things as: routes to employment (voluntary work, work placements, etc); education (courses which are vocational or just for enjoyment); recreation (helping people to access facilities such as cinemas, sports facilities, etc); and encouraging people to adopt more healthy lifestyles.  This support is delivered, reviewed and monitored according to Care Programme Approach protocols.  Referrals taken mainly from the Community Mental Health Teams in the West.  Part of the Sheffield Health &amp; Social Care NHS Foundation Trust.</entry>
