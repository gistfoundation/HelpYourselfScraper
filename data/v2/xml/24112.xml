</OrgName>
<Desc><entry>The Janus Project Domestic Violence Intervention Programme is the only voluntary programme for men who want to change their abusive behaviour within Sheffield and the surrounding area.  Offers long-term group based intervention for men wishing to change their violent and/or abusive behaviour.  Aims to contribute to the reduction of domestic violence and abuse within the home.  Works to break the cycle of abuse.  Works directly with male perpetrators who attend the groups voluntarily.  Offers support to current or ex partners of the men accessing the programme.  The Janus Project is a rolling programme in which you can start or leave at any stage but it is strongly recommended that you attend for at least 12 months.  Once contacting the service you will be invited to attend up to 6 one-to-one sessions in preparation for the group phase of the programme.  This is a voluntary programme and a desire and motivation to change is essential.  This project is a registered charity.</entry>
