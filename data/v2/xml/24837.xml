The aim of the project is to extend social networks and to support people with learning disabilities to widen their circle of friends by organising monthly events for members to get together, meet people and have fun.  The project can also help and enable members to meet up on a one-to-one basis allowing friendships to blossom in a safe and supported way.  Volunteers welcome.</entry>
