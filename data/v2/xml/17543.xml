<Desc><entry>The object of the registered charity is the relief of single women whether unmarried, divorced or widowed who are in conditions of need, hardship or distress and who are aged 40 years and over.  Beneficiaries need to be members of the Church of England or a Church having full membership of Churches Together in Britain and Ireland or any body which is formed in succession to that body.  The trustees may relieve persons by making grants of money to them; or providing or paying for goods, services or facilities for them; or by making grants of money to other persons or organisations who provide goods, services or facilities to those in need.  In exceptional cases (to be determined by the trustees) assistance may be available to someone otherwise qualified who is resident outside the UK or only temporarily resident in the UK.  Distribute grants annually in December.</entry>
