<Desc><entry>Beekeeper willing to remove swarms in Walkley, Hillsborough and the North West of Sheffield.  Will only collect where there is easy access to the whole swarm.  Will not collect where they are nesting in cavities, chimneys etc.  No ladder work.  There is a charge for this service which covers the cost of the beekeeper treating the bees for Veroa, which stops them passing the virus on to the bees in their own hives.</entry>
