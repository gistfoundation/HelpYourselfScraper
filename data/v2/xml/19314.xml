<Desc><entry>Adult mental health day service which is part of Sheffield Health and Social Care Foundation Trust.  Services are recovery focused, and workers work in a variety of settings, including community venues and the service bases, to deliver or facilitate individually tailored Recovery Plans to individuals, in partnership with them.  This is done by appropriate educational and confidence building groups and activities, working in partnership with other organisations, and appropriate signposting to other opportunities.  The main focus is to help people achieve their own aspirations in life, with an emphasis on recovery and vocational rehabilitation.  This can be part of someone's Self Directed Support package of care.  Each individual's progress and outcomes are regularly reviewed.  There are also opportunities to socialise with peers, in the service buildings and community venues, if this is an appropriate part of the recovery plan.  Referral is usually via the Community Mental Health Teams.</entry>
