<Desc><entry>A registered charity that offers a positive, fun and friendly environment, providing long-term support, encouragement and practical help to children and their families.  Offers a flexible and specialist service for children and young people who have life limiting and terminal conditions both through the 'Hospice in the Home' care service and in the hospice.  The main emphasis is not on the illness or disability, but on each individual child's need to enjoy the very best quality of life and fulfil their wishes whilst looking after the physical, emotional and spiritual needs of both the child and their family throughout their limited lives.  24 hour on-call service for palliative and end of life care.  Self or any referral.</entry>
