<Desc><entry>A residential project for families where substance misuse is a problem.  Service users gain support to identify and resolve substance misuse issues whilst remaining as primary care givers for their children.  

PFFS offers a combination of group work, one-to-one key sessions and written work to bring about change.  Parents are supported to enhance and develop parenting skills to work in the best interests of their child/children.  PFFS is based on a Therapeutic Community Model and utilises Cognitive Behavioural Therapy.  

The aim of the service is to provide an intensive residential rehabilitation programme that enables families to become drug free and stay together.  Accepts couples or single parents of either gender and children up to the age of 10 years.  Part of a national registered charity.  Referral via health practitioner, social services or voluntary agency.</entry>
