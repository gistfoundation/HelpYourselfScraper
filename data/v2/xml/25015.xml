These services are provided by volunteers who are trained to become learning mentors and then placed in an appropriate care home to ensure the best possible volunteering experience.  L4A is now recruiting new learning mentors for the Sheffield area who wish to volunteer for 2-3 hours per week - please contact for further details.  Company limited by guarantee no 06586596.</entry>
