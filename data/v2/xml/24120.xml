<AltName><entry>SHEFFIELD LOCAL INVOLVEMENT NETWORK</entry>
</AltName>
<Desc><entry>A network of local people, organisations and groups that has been set up by the Department of Health to make sure that health and social care services are planned and delivered to meet the needs of the people that use them.  LINk looks at all health and social care services across the city and works in partnership with existing networks to bring together the views of the whole community.  Members of the public can join the mailing list to keep up-to-date with LINk activities, suggest issues for LINk to explore, take part in groups looking into specific issues or assist in running LINk.  LINk has been given specific powers to ask health and social care commissioners for information about their services and expect a response and refer matters to the local council's Overview and Scrutiny Committee.</entry>
