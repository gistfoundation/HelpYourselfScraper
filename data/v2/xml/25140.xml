<Desc><entry>The Sheffield Property Shop website has current vacancies of Council and Housing Association properties available for rent. These can be bidded for using the online Choice Based Lettings system which offers greater choice and flexibility in finding a home.  Also produces a newspaper of available lettings which is available in some libraries and other council buildings open to the public.  People can join the Sheffield City Council's housing register at the Property Shop and tenants can access other Sheffield Homes and housing services and get advice about accessible properties.</entry>
