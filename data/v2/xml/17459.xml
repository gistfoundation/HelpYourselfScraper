Held at the purpose built Lifewise Centre in Rotherham, it gives children the opportunity to get involved in different scenarios such as road safety, fire safety, anti-social behaviour, drugs and alcohol, first aid, running away from home and a Magistrates court.  Crucial Crew is a partnership project between South Yorkshire Police and South Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service.  Other partners and voluntary agencies contribute to the project.</entry>
