<OrgName><entry>JIGSAW AUTISM BEFRIENDING SCHEME</entry>
</OrgName>
<Desc><entry>Befriending scheme for children and young people (aged 5-18 years) with an autistic spectrum disorder.  Run by Volunteering with Hallam Union.  Befrienders are students at Sheffield Hallam University.  Aims to support families and enable young people with an autistic spectrum disorder to take part in activities (often at home).  Roles are negotiated and volunteers are not expected to perform domestic duties.  The scheme runs throughout the academic year, October to May.  Befrienders are matched in October/November and visits take place at the family home by negotiation between the family and the befriender - often once a week for two hours.</entry>
