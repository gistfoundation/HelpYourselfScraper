<Desc><entry>There are four Sector Community Mental Health Teams (CMHT) in Sheffield providing a service for patients with mental health problems other than Schizophrenia and Bipolar Disorder.  The types of conditions treated include depression, anxiety, personality disorder, attention deficit hyperactive disorder (ADHD) and post traumatic stress.  The Sector CMHT team will provide specialist advice to GPs, offer a full assessment and where appropriate a treatment package.  The service is provided by a range of professionals including psychiatrists, community mental health nurses, social workers, psychologists, cognitive behavioural psychotherapists and occupational therapists.  The service will normally be accessed by referral from a GP.  In some instances the service can be accessed by other NHS professionals, NHS Direct and voluntary services.</entry>
