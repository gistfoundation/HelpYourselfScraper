<Desc><entry>A residential project, part of a national charity, committed to the care of adults recovering from problematic drug or alcohol use in a therapeutic community setting.  A variety of group work and individual interventions are used with an emphasis on peer group involvement and self-help to explore the underlying reasons for their problems with drugs/alcohol and learn new skills to develop a drug/alcohol-free lifestyle.

The treatment programme is approximately 6 to 9 months long with a further period of around 6 months in the resettlement project.  The daily routine is centred around activities that are carried out within a structured framework.  The re-entry support service aids residents to return to the community and continue to live drug/alcohol-free lives.  

Open to men and women aged 18 years and over.  Referrals taken direct or through other agencies.</entry>
