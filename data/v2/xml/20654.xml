<Desc><entry>Provided by the Neighbourhoods and Community Care Directorate of Sheffield City Council.  Provides long term care, short breaks, day care and befriending to adults who are vulnerable because they have learning, physical, mental health, sensory disabilities or are older.  The service is registered with the Care Quality Commission.  Carers are ordinary people from a wide range of backgrounds reflecting the population of Sheffield. They are trained and supported by the service. There is a charge for Adult Placement services but how much people have to pay depends on their individual financial circumstances.  The service is only offered to people who have been assessed as entitled to care services arranged by the Council and are referred by a social worker or care manager. The service is always looking to recruit new carers.</entry>
