</OrgName>
<Desc><entry>A group run by Breast Cancer Care (see separate entry) for people with a diagnosis of secondary breast cancer.  With the support of an experienced counsellor members have an opportunity to talk openly with others who really understand about what it is like to live with this diagnosis.  The group is small (up to 10 people) and welcoming and meetings are based on whatever members want to talk about that week.  This group is a registered charity.</entry>
