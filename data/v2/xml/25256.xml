<Desc><entry>Lydgate Green is a small park adjacent to Lydgate Lane in Crosspool and straddles Lydgate Hall Crescent.  The land was donated to the people of Sheffield in 1934 by JG Graves and is held in Trust.  Friends of Lydgate Green is a group of local residents who, in association with Sheffield City Council and through local donations, have installed benches, litter bins and a dog waste bin and maintain the gardens by planting and weeding flower beds, pruning bushes, putting up bird and bat boxes, litter picking etc.  The park is well used by local people and as a teaching resource for the local primary school and scout/guides groups and has been the venue for local gatherings and for events in the annual Crosspool Festival.</entry>
