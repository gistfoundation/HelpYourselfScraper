<Desc><entry>Provides sessions for: adults with profound and complex learning difficulties, including people with challenging behaviour and autism; adults with moderate learning difficulties; and young people with learning difficulties.  Sessions have been carefully developed to provide the right environment in which to enjoy art, music dance, IT, sport, and music and movement activities.  Some sessions take place in a sensory room.  Staff are creative and well trained in all forms of art and drama.  Also provides outreach sessions offering people with a learning disability the support to access social activities in the community.  Offers an individualistic service looking at the interests, likes and dislikes to ensure that the person receiving the service has a fun time.  Match well trained and experienced staff with each individual to hopefully create friendships, continuity and trust.  Activities include swimming, cinema trips, bowling, discos, going out for meals, visiting the local pub, walks in the countryside or parks and trips to the seaside.</entry>
