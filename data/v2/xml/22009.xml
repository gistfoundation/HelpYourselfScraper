<Desc><entry>Falun Dafa also known as Falun Gong is what the Chinese call a traditional cultivation practice.  Practitioners cultivate themselves mentally, spiritually and physically by repeating five tranquil exercises and always behaving according to the principle of Truthfulness, Compassion and Tolerance.  Body-mind-spirit development is an important aspect of oriental culture.  Falun Dafa is neither religion nor a political movement having no desire for ritual or temporal power.  Exercises are carried out to quiet Chinese music which helps with timing and focus.  Anyone can participate.</entry>
