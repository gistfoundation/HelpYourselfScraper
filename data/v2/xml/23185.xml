<Desc><entry>A registered charity which offers semi-supported housing to pregnant young women and young mothers aged 16-25 years (up to the age of 35 years if they have a mild to moderate learning disability). Has 6, 2 bedroom, fully furnished houses, 2 in Foxhill and 4 in Walkley.  Each young woman will receive weekly support from her keyworker.  Together they will identify needs, goals and risks, and work towards developing the young woman's skills and confidence to live independently.  Length of stay is 6 months to 2 years.  When both keyworker and the young woman feel support is no longer required, assistance is given to access appropriate housing.  Referral via GP, health professional, the Children and Young People's Service or the Neighbourhoods and Community Care Directorate or voluntary agency.</entry>
