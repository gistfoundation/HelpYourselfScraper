<OrgName><entry>MAGISTRATES IN THE COMMUNITY - SPEAKERS FOR MEETINGS</entry>
</OrgName>
<Desc><entry>Offers a participatory and informative presentation for any adult group about the history, work, powers and place in the justice system of lay magistrates.  Can involve roleplay if desired, in which the audience is given the opportunity to come to decisions and pronounce sentences on scenarios based on authentic cases put before the local magistrate's court, to give reasons for its verdicts and sentences, and to see how they fit within the provisions of the law.  The presentation can be adapted to suit requirements.  Daytime and evening dates are available.  No fee is charged but donations to a charity of the group's choice are welcome.</entry>
