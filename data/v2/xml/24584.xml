<Desc><entry>An NHS service for overweight and obese children in Sheffield.  Works with children aged 7-14 years and their parents/carers to support healthy lifestyles, encourage healthier eating habits, increase physical activity and improve emotional wellbeing.  Each family meets a dedicated Watch It Health Trainer once a week for a minimum of 16 weeks and for up to a year.  Each child also attends weekly physical activities run by Activity Sheffield, which aim to take the emphasis away from competitiveness and back on fun and enjoyment of exercise.  Accepts referrals from parents, GPs and school nurses for children on or above the 91st centile on the Body Mass Index (the service can help you to calculate a child's BMI).</entry>
