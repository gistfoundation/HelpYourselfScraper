<Desc><entry>A pair of 14 feet high processional giants called War and Peace.  These were made by a Catalan giant-maker and were presented to the City of Sheffield by Catalunya in 1992.  They are available for bookings for parades and festivals.  The giants perform dances accompanied by musicians and new members are always welcome to become musicians, porters and crew.  In 2008 the giants represented the city of Sheffield at the 400th anniversary of the founding of Quebec City.</entry>
