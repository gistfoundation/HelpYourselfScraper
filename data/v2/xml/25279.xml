<OrgName><entry>GET WALKING KEEP WALKING (RAMBLERS)</entry>
</OrgName>
<Desc><entry>An  urban walking project developed by the Ramblers (see separate entry) to increase regular independent walking among previously inactive or insufficiently active people in Sheffield.  The project aims to encourage people to achieve the government's recommended goal of walking for 30 minutes per day, 5 days per week and to get them walking more as part of their everyday lives, thereby making a contribution to physical and mental well-being.  The project is targeted at people on low income groups, from black and minority ethnic backgrounds or people with physical and mental health difficulties.  The project is funded by the Big Lottery until December 2011.  Register for the walking pack and stepcounter at MyGetWalking website and find short walking routes in Sheffield.  Community groups and schools are welcome to get involved. Company registration 4458492</entry>
