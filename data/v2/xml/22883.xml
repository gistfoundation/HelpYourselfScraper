<Desc><entry>Approximately 2.5 million people are served by the department of Neurosciences at the Royal Hallamshire Hospital, including patients from Lincoln, Doncaster, Barnsley, Rotherham, Mansfield and Bassetlaw.  Neurocare raises money to buy very specialised equipment for the Neurosciences Department - equipment that would not have been bought by the NHS.  They help patients who suffer from brain tumours, head injury, stroke, MS, Parkinson's disease, epilepsy, motor neurone disease, cancers of the nervous system, etc.  They aim to have one of the best equipped departments in the country.</entry>
