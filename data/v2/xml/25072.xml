</OrgName>
<Desc><entry>Nordic walking is an enhancement of ordinary walking, making it twice as effective.  It is a specific fitness technique and is not to be confused with trekking, hill walking or trail running.  The use of poles means the upper body muscles are used as well as the legs.  It is very effective at conditioning the abdominal muscles that provide core stability.  It is one of the fastest growing fitness activities in the world because it is highly effective, affordable and above all fun.  Courses are located in Graves Park, Millhouses Park, Whirlowbrook Park and Chatsworth Park in the Peak District.</entry>
