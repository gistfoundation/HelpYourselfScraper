<Desc><entry>Self directed support and personal budgets is a new approach to social care that puts people in control of the support that they need.  It is a more personal system which gives people more choice, it lets them decide what type of support they want, who will provide it, when and how.  Self directed support is available to people who are eligible for social care support.  It lets people identify their own social care needs and plan how to meet them with a personal budget.  With self directed support a person indentifies their eligible social care needs by completing an assessment questionnaire; is the told how much money is available to meet their needs; develops a support plan showing how their needs will be met and decides how their services are arranged.</entry>
