<Desc><entry>Aims to improve the facilities and environment of the park and make sure the park serves the needs of all the community.  Works in partnership with Sheffield City Council.  Has funded improvements to the football area, a youth shelter, picnic benches and table and a 'K' barrier to try and stop motorised vehicles entering and parking illegally.  Has also made improvements to the multi use games area, installed a practice cricket net, increased cycle parking, seating and litter bins.  Also plans to improve/develop the old boating lake near the Clock Tower. The Friends are developing activities in the bowling pavilion and organising a series of fun days in the park.</entry>
