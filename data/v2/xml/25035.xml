The centres can provide access to advice on health, education and training, housing, substance misuse, finance and family issues.  All the centres provide creche facilities so that service users can focus on the issues they need to address while their children have fun in a safe environment.  The aim of the project is to prevent women offending and as such welcomes self-referrals and referrals from voluntary agencies already engaged in dealing with some of the pathways that lead to offending behaviour.
