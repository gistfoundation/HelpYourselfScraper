<OrgName><entry>CHOICES NOT BARRIERS (DISABLED HOUSING STRATEGY) MONITORING AND SCRUTINY GROUP</entry>
</OrgName>
<Desc><entry>A small informal group, chaired by a disabled person, that plays a key role in developing and monitoring Choices Not Barriers - Sheffield City Council's housing strategy for people with physical, sensory and cognitive impairments, learning disabilities and mental health problems.  The group meets approximately 8 times a year, in a fully accessible city centre venue, with each meeting based around a theme relating to housing and neighbourhoods.  The group aims to help remove the barriers that disabled people often face in accessing housing services.  New members are always welcome as the group needs service users experiences, views and expertise to help develop the strategy to fully meet  the needs of disabled people.  Reasonable expenses for travel, child care and other care needs will be paid on production of a receipt.</entry>
