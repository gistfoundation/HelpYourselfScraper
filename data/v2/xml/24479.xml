<Desc><entry>The Local Friends Project puts international students in touch with local people.  The project allows local people and students to get to know each others' cultures.  Volunteers can meet over coffee, cook dinner for each other or maybe explore Sheffield together.  The scheme has been very successful in the past and has included hosts such as the Lord Mayor of Sheffield.</entry>
